            <p>
                My name is <strong>Juan Diego Sanchez</strong>, I use the username <strong>Chnmrn</strong> online, I am a developer learning about programming everyday,
                and I try to improve my skills doing little personal projects for now.
                I try to learn about some concepts I never learn about in university trying to make my path as a developer by myself meanwhile I look for a job.
                I have some knowledge in C#, HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript and Java. I am no professional but I try to become one.
                I hope this information changes throught the time when I learn more and improve my skills in the future.

            <p>
                This website is a personal playground where I try to implement new things and see how can I improve my skills in <span class="highlight">full-stack</span>.
                I am used in do backend development, but I want to learn more about frontend and design. even tho I have some struggles in creating things that look good but this is also part of the process.
                I will try to do implementation and creation of different codes to improve my UI/UX skills and my programming skills in general.

            <p>
                The future of the web will blur the boundary between digital and physical.
                My work explores that edge — through interactive nodes, glitch aesthetics,
                and immersive designs that respond to emotion and input.
