            <h2>Full-Stack Web System for the school "La Granja"</h2>
            <p>
                Me and my teammates created a full working system for a school, we build up the interface and backend functions of the staff of the school sites and the parents sites,
                there is inclusion of security configurations, for the access of the users and management on the relation and configuration of diferent tables in the database.
                This was made with <span class="highlight">C# as an MVC ASP including languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, with inclusion of SQL</span>,
                and there are many differences between the basic CRUD system, like the management of roles and permissions, different types of users with different access levels,
                creation of reports. This is my first big project working in a team and using all my effort because it was made for a real school, so it was more than just an university project.

            <h2>Slime Dum</h2>
            <p>
                A videogame made as an university project, it was made in <span class="highlight">Unity and C#</span>, the game is a 2D platform and it is about a slime who goes through levels to finish it.
                It has some bugs and errors that need to be changed but it was my first experience creating a videogame and learning the basics of game development, but I plan to modify those changes in a future.
                You will see very basic things about videogames, scenes, characters, enemies, boss fight, menu.
